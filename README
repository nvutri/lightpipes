Example scripts are available from the same place.

To build the package on a Unix computer edit makefile and type
make. The only thing to define is the calling sequence for a compiler
to use. Gcc is highly recommended, cc is default.

To build the package under MSDOS using DJGPP compiler (available from
SIMTEL archive and its mirrors over the world) type

make -f makedos
